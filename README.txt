This project contains code for part 1 of the course Natural Language Processing Technology 2022 at VU Amsterdam put together by Lisa Beinborn.

References:
The modelling part draws substantially on the code project for the Stanford course cs230-stanford developed by Surag Nair, Guillaume Genthial and Olivier Moindrot (https://github.com/cs230-stanford/cs230-code-examples/tree/master/pytorch/nlp).
It has been simplified and adapted by Lisa Beinborn.

This is our implementation.
